        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>College is a time of transformation newfound independence, late night study sessions, and the challenge of balancing academics, social life, and selfcare. But amidst the excitement and responsibilities, one thing often gets overlooked: <strong>your health.</strong></p>
    
        <p>At <strong>VitalHealth Hub</strong>, we understand that leaving home means leaving behind the structure and care that once ensured you got the right nutrition. No more reminders from parents. No stocked pantry of supplements. No one ensuring you're taking what your body needs. That's where we come in.</p>
